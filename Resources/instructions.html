        <h1>InstaSupply Coding Test</h1>

        <p>Please be aware that we are using the code you create in this test
        to assess your experience and technical ability. The less code you
        write in place of configuration, the less able we are to fairly assess
        you, therefore please <strong>do not use</strong>
        large configuration-heavy web frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, or
        Symfony. Microframeworks such as Flask, Sinatra, Slim, or Flight,
        however, are fine.</p>

        <p>Please create a simple web application that serves the example
        web page shown below in valid semantic HTML and CSS, in accordance with
        web standards.</p>

        <p>The page should:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Store data on the server side, enforcing a unique email address.</li>
            <li>Provide server-side validation of all fields.</li>
            <li>Provide client-side validation of all fields.</li>
            <li>Check password at point of entry against a blacklist of
            passwords (provided) that must only be stored on the server.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Please ensure your repository includes all files to allow us to
        replicate and configure your environment ourselves.</p>

        <p>You are free to use the server-side language of your choice, and
        any frameworks (see above), libraries or tools you feel are necessary to
        build this application that will demonstrate your experience and
        abilities. You are also free to design the user-journeys for
        validation however you choose.</p>

        <p>These requirements are ambiguous on purpose and should be considered
        the same as an initial set of requirements. Feel free to use your
        knowledge and experience to improve or correct any issues you feel
        users might face.</p>

        <h2>Time limit</h2>

        <p>You have 2 days in which to complete this task and will have been
        provided a deadline at the point of receiving these files as to when
        you must return your code by.</p>

        <h2>Submitting your code</h2>

        <p>Please submit your code either by emailing back a zipped code
        repository, or by giving us a link to a public GitHub or BitBucket
        repository.</p>

        <p>Please also include comments in the code laying out your method,
        why you made particular choices, how you might improve things given
        more time, and your overall thought processes throughout.</p>

        <p>A working public example is welcome but not required.</p>
